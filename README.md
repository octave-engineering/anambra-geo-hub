# Anambra GeoHub

## Project Overview
Anambra GeoHub is a prototype platform designed to catalog, visualize, and analyze health and geospatial datasets for Anambra State.  
The portal provides **role-based access** for different stakeholders:

- **Public users** → explore maps, dashboards, and selected datasets.  
- **Partners (NGOs, donors, research bodies)** → access harmonized datasets and visualizations.  
- **Admin (Anambra State Government)** → manage data, users, and system configuration.  

The system supports CSV, GeoJSON, and Excel datasets, with the ability to download and use them in tools like **QGIS** for deeper analysis.
